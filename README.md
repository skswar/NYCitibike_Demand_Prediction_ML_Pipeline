## Introduction
Implemented in New York City, Citi Bikes have become a popular bike-sharing system, providing convenient transportation for residents and tourists alike. With millions of daily customers using Citi Bikes for various purposes such as commuting, shopping, and leisure, the system has over 1500+ stations across New York and Jersey City. Ensuring an adequate supply of bikes at each station can be challenging, but data science plays a crucial role in addressing this issue. By employing an end-to-end machine learning pipeline, the usage of bikes can be tracked, and hourly predictions of bike rides can be made. This enables the business to better understand demand patterns, timely replenish bikes at the docks, and manage the distribution of bikes across different stations. Ultimately, this data-driven approach enhances operational efficiency, resulting in increased ride availability and satisfied customers.
